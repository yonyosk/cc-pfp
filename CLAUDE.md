# Telos — Product Context

## Product Overview
**Product:** Telos
**Type:** B2B SaaS — Project Management Platform
**Stage:** Growth (Series B)
**Team size:** 45 employees (12 in product & engineering)

## What We Build
Telos helps mid-size companies (50–500 employees) manage cross-team projects.
Core features: task management, sprint planning, team dashboards, integrations (Slack, Jira, GitHub).

## Our Users
### Primary: Project Managers (our champion)
- Pain: too many tools, too little visibility across teams
- Goal: one place to see everything, report to leadership
- Technical level: medium (uses Jira, Notion, Slack daily)

### Secondary: Team Members
- Pain: unclear priorities, constant context switching
- Goal: know what to work on, in what order

## Business Goals (This Quarter)
1. Reduce churn: target 4% monthly → 2.5%
2. Increase activation: 30% of signups reach "first project created" within 48h (currently 18%)
3. Enterprise readiness: SSO + audit logs for deals >$50k/year

## My Role
Product Manager — Growth & Retention squad
- Own: onboarding flow, notifications, integrations
- Deliverables: PRDs, user stories, prioritization docs, stakeholder updates
- Stakeholders: VP Product (Noa), CTO (Avi), Customer Success lead (Dana)

## Tech Stack (for context)

- Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: AWS
- Integrations: Slack, Jira, GitHub, Zapier

## Working Preferences for Claude
- Language: Hebrew preferred, English for technical terms
- Always ask clarifying questions before starting a document
- Use bullet points, headers, tables — easy to scan
- Include "Open Questions" section in all docs
- When prioritizing: use RICE or Impact/Effort, show your reasoning
- Stakeholder updates: short, clear, one action item at the end

## Sprint Cadence
